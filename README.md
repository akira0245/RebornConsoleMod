# RebornConsoleMod
a modified Reborn Console plugin for Reborbuddy which supports new c# language features.

Check this on in plugin tab to add a button on RB's main window for opening console.

It enables visual styles for all winform windows in rebornbuddy. (which not a single plugin should do but who cares?)

Right click on text box to enable/disable word wrap or change layout.
